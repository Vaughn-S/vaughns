More About Me 🔍
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Vaughn Smith and I'm from Rochester, New York 🌻.
Before USC, I was at Cleveland State University for Biology - Pre-Health & NCAA Div I Fencing 🤺.
My GitHub is a place where I keep some of my coding projects both old and new.
Most of my work is either Chemistry 🥼 or Baseball ⚾ related.
Hopefully at least one of those is interesting to you 🙂.
If you have any questions about me or my code, please feel free to reach out to me via *Text* or *Email*. 
Please do not call, I more than likely won't pick up if I don't recognize the number.
Sorry 😢

Thanks for reading 🫶
